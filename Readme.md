This is a quick and dirty minimal file system that was written in a couple of days. At this time, it does only creation and listing of directories. It has a framework that allows persistence to various Key-Value stores like LevelDB, RocksDB and RamCloud. At this time, support for only LevelDB has been added. Interfaces exist for the other KV Stores and adding support to them should be straight forward.
